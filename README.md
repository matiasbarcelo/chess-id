This repo is a clone of Yang's Chess ID project.

My final project and orignal work is located in Final_Project.ipynb

I have also included some of the Jupyter Notebook files from class that helped me throughout the project.

Thank you for everything this semester! I plan on continuing this project and will hopefully be able build the caffe deep learning framework using CMake soon.
